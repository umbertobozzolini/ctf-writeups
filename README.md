# CTF & Lab Writeups

This repository contains my personal writeups and lab notes from **CTF-style cybersecurity training platforms**, including:

- TryHackMe
- Hack The Box
- INE (eJPT preparation)

The goal of this repository is **not just to capture flags**, but to document my learning process and demonstrate a **clear penetration testing methodology**, covering:

- Reconnaissance & enumeration
- Service and application analysis
- Exploitation
- Privilege escalation
- Lessons learned

These writeups reflect my progression as a beginner transitioning into cybersecurity, with a focus on **clarity, structure, and real understanding**, rather than speed or shortcuts.
